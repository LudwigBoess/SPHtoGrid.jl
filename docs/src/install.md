# Install

As usual with Julia you can install the package via the internal package manager

```@example
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/LudwigBoess/SPHtoGrid.jl
```

If you don't have it installed yet and until [https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/pull/1628](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/pull/1628) has been merged you will also need to install [GadgetIO.jl](https://github.com/LudwigBoess/GadgetIO.jl) first

```@example
julia> ]
pkg> add https://github.com/LudwigBoess/GadgetIO.jl
```

Now you should be good to go!
